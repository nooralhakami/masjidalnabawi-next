# Architecture — Prophet's Mosque Visitor Guide («next»)

> **ملخص بالعربية:** موقع ثابت بلا خادم، بطبقات تعتمد كل منها على ما تحتها فقط:
> **data ← domain ← routing ← location / i18n ← presentation ← state ← ui / map ← app**.
> الطبقات الخمس الأولى منقولة حرفياً من التطبيق الحالي، وهي التي تضمن أن البحث والمسارات وجدول الروضة ونتائج المواقف تبقى مطابقة.
> الجديد ثلاث طبقات:
> - **state:** حالة مشتركة بـsignals.
> - **ui:** مكوّنات Preact فوق الخريطة.
> - **map:** MapLibre GL، كل العلامات فيها طبقة GPU واحدة.

## 1. Shape of the system
- **Static site, no server, no accounts, no tracking.** Two pages: `index.html` (landing, Arabic prerendered at build time) and `map.html` (the app). Hosted later on a *new* Vercel project.
- **Everything runs on the device.** Search, routing (Dijkstra on the bundled graphs) and navigation run on the phone. The visitor's position never leaves it.
- **External requests:**
  - Map tiles: Esri World Imagery, and OSM standard tiles for the light base.
  - Weather: Open-Meteo, at fixed Madinah coordinates.
  - Nothing else. In particular there is no glyph or font server.
- **PWA:** the app shell, the data and the street graph are precached. Map tiles and story photos are never precached (tile licence, first-load weight).

## 2. Layers and the dependency rule
```
data/  (JSON source of truth, byte-identical to the live app)      scripts/ (rebuild data/ from documented sources)
   │
src/data          load + types + overrides                      ┐
src/domain        filters, search, facilities, parking, rawdah, │  ported verbatim from e0c6ca7
                  weather, geo, nearby, visits, library         │  pure: no DOM, no map library
src/routing       plaza walkways, streets, garage, plan, alts   │
src/location      LocationService, Kalman filter, RouteTrack    │  browser APIs only (MeMarker dropped)
src/i18n          t()/nm()/ds(), 26 languages, dir              ┘
src/presentation  pure view-model: marker look (tier, colour,     ← ported from ui/markers.ts + ui/poi-view.ts,
                  icon, size, visibility), card fields, labels      no DOM: unit-tested
src/navigation    NavigationTracker logic (progress, away, off-   ← ported logic; emits snapshots, no Leaflet, no DOM
                  route, switch, arrival, car-park steps)
src/state         signals: lang, theme, filter, query, selected, ← tiny, no DOM
                  sheet detent, travel, level, route, nav snapshot
src/ui            Preact components over the map                 ← never imports map/
src/map           MapLibre: setup, sources, layers, sprites,      ← never imports ui/
                  route layer, me-marker, camera
src/app           wiring for map.html (the only place ui ↔ map meet)
src/landing       landing page (view SSR'd at build time)
src/styles        tokens.css + Tailwind v4 entry + component CSS
```
**Rules.** They are enforced by `tests/unit/architecture.test.ts`, extended for the new folders.
1. A module imports only from layers above it in the diagram.
2. `domain/`, `routing/`, `presentation/` and `navigation/` never touch the DOM or `maplibre-gl`.
3. `ui/` and `map/` don't import each other. They meet only through `state/` signals and the wiring in `src/app/`.
4. Ported files keep their paths (`src/domain/search.ts` …), so a diff with the live app stays readable.

## 4. Key flows
- **Filter / search → map.**
  - `ui` writes `filter` / `query` signals.
  - `app` computes `visiblePois()` (ported) into a `Set<number>` of ids.
  - `map/pois` applies one `setFilter(['in', ['get','id'], ['literal', ids]])` per layer.
  - Nothing is rebuilt and no GeoJSON is re-uploaded. Each change is O(n) once, not per frame.
- **Marker look.**
  - The look comes from `presentation/marker-look.ts` (ported rules: tier by zoom, 8/14/20 px, 4/5 px when zoomed out, gate chips from 17, inner numbers and names from 19, gold halo for the 9 must-visit sites, lock for subscriber lots).
  - It is baked into feature properties once at load, and expressed as zoom `step`/`interpolate` expressions.
  - The GPU does the rest.
- **Selection.**
  - Triggered by a marker tap, a search result or `?poi=ID`.
  - `selected` signal → `feature-state` on the place, and a filter that hides the other places (current behaviour).
  - `camera.flyTo` into the visible gap between the top bar and the sheet, and the sheet springs to half.
  - As built (phase 4): `App.select()` sets `selected` and `sheet`; an effect in `map-main` calls `engine.select(id)` (a `selected` layer with the pin, every other layer filtered off) and `engine.focus(id, {top, bottom})` uses MapLibre camera padding (top bar bottom + 8, half-sheet height). Closing the card also clears the search (owner, 2026-10-14).
  - A map tap: the engine picks the nearest marker within 16 px and sends `map-tap`; nothing near → the card closes.
  - `?poi=ID` is read once in `map-main` and handed to `App` as `initial`, opened when the card is mounted (an event sent earlier was lost: a race seen in the e2e run).
- **Route (as built, phase 5).**
  - `app/trip.ts` holds the trip: the live app's drawRoute / showPlans / pickRoute / re-route / switch / way-out wiring, unchanged in what it decides.
  - It writes the `route` (summary), `nav` (tracker snapshot) and `garageQ` (the car park question) signals; `ui/route/` (RouteCard, NavBar, GarageAsk) renders them; `map/route.ts` draws.
  - The car park question is a Promise answered by the UI (no DOM in the trip).
  - Camera: `fitBounds` after the sheet has settled to its fitted height (the sheet's `fit` mode: content height, ≤ 45% of the screen); padding is reset first, because MapLibre adds fitBounds' padding to the current one.
  - Nav types the UI needs (`StepView`, `NavView`, `STATE_LABEL`) live in `presentation/route-view.ts`, so ui/ never imports navigation/. The architecture test now also checks `.tsx` files.
- **Route.**
  - The sheet's button triggers a location request, only now.
  - In or by the car park, `GarageAsk` asks where the car is.
  - `routing/plan.planRoutes` is lazy-imported on the first route.
  - `map/route.show(plans)` draws the route, and `navigation/tracker` starts.
  - Snapshots go to the `nav` signal, so the UI counters and the step banner update and `map/route.focus(ahead150)` follows.
  - Updating the "ahead" line is a `setData` on a ≤150 m line: tiny and bounded.
- **Deep links (as built).** `map-main` reads `?poi=`, `?visit=`, `?lib=`, `?admin=1` once and hands them to `App` as props, opened when it mounts (events sent earlier were lost, phase 4).
- **Landing and PWA (phase 7).** `vite.config.ts`:
  - `prerenderLanding` writes the Arabic landing into index.html.
  - `inlineCss` puts each page's CSS in its HTML.
  - `VitePWA` precaches the shell (both pages, chunks, Arabic/Latin fonts), never map tiles or story photos.
  - `app/pwa.ts` registers the service worker from each page; updates apply on the next visit.
- **Lazy parts.** `App` loads the stories, the library and the admin panel with dynamic `import()` on first use; their CSS is imported by the component, so Vite splits it with them.
- **Language.**
  - Changing the `lang` signal sets `<html lang/dir>`, and the UI re-renders.
  - The map relabels: only the label sprites of the new language are drawn.
  - No reload.

## 5. Map: decisions and known pitfalls
- **Zoom scale.** MapLibre's world is 512 px at zoom 0. With 256 px raster tiles, MapLibre zoom = Leaflet zoom − 1.
  - Every threshold in the ported rules is a *Leaflet* zoom: default 17, max 19, 16/15/14 shrink steps, 17 gate chips, 18 pair numbers, 19 inner names.
  - They all pass through `legacyZoom()` in `map/zoom.ts`.
  - A test checks that the opening view frames the same outer-gate bounds as the live app.
- **Base layers.** Raster Esri (`tileSize: 256`, `maxzoom` 19 in tile terms) and OSM light.
  - Attribution is always visible: «Tiles © Esri — Source: Esri, Maxar, Earthstar Geographics» + «© OpenStreetMap».
  - The first tiles are preloaded in `map.html` before JS, as in the live app, recomputed for MapLibre's scale.
- **Labels and marker images.** No external glyph server and no text layers. Every marker (dots, icon discs, number chips, car-park chips, must-visit badges with their halo, pair numbers, gate-name labels) is an image drawn on a canvas in the live app's shapes (`map/images.ts`), with the app's fonts, so the browser shapes Arabic. An image is drawn the first time the map needs it (`map.setMissingStyleImageResolver`, MapLibre 6; the old `styleimagemissing` event can no longer supply one), and the rest are drawn ahead in idle time. Image ids end in `@<version>`; a theme or language change bumps the version and the layers ask for fresh images.
- **Marker rules.** `presentation/marker-look.ts` turns each place into feature properties (kind, colour token, icon, image key); a unit test checks it agrees with the live app's `markerSpec` for all 324 places. Facility markers never collide (`icon-allow-overlap` + `icon-ignore-placement`: nothing is merged or hidden); only outer-gate chips and gate-name labels collide, as the live app declutters them.
- **Worker.** MapLibre 6 runs its worker from a separate module: `import workerUrl from 'maplibre-gl/dist/maplibre-gl-worker.mjs?worker&url'` + `setWorkerUrl(workerUrl)`, so Vite bundles it with its shared chunk. Version 6 has no default export: import by name.
- **Rotation.** Two-finger rotate and the ±15° buttons.
  - The compass needle follows true north, with the Kaaba mark toward the qibla.
  - Pitch is locked to 0 (SPEC §9-6).
- **Routes.**
  - Line layers with `lineMetrics: true`; the draw-in animates the `line-gradient` progress.
  - Level A gets a yellow casing; ramps get a yellow (up) or green (down) casing.
  - Arrows are a symbol layer with `symbol-placement: line`, spacing ≈ 55 m converted per zoom.
  - Alternatives are faint lines with a wide invisible hit line and a time label.
- **Map buttons.** As in the live app, whatever the language: zoom and rotation on the right, the other buttons (base map now; stories, library, my location later) on the left. +15° turns the map clockwise (MapLibre bearing −15); the compass needle shows where north is on screen.
- **Visitor dot.** One DOM marker, glide 900 ms ease-out.
  - The accuracy circle is a GeoJSON circle (fill).
  - The heading cone is compensated for bearing.
- **Marker pop-in.** A new filter (or markers shown again) fades the marker layers in: opacity 0 for one frame, then a 200 ms paint transition back to 1 (`MapEngine.pop`, the live app's `.mk-pop`). Only on a tap, never during a gesture; skipped with reduced motion. The nine must-visit sites and the open card's pin do not fade.
- **Gesture hygiene.**
  - Nothing toggles classes on `<body>` during gestures.
  - No `backdrop-filter`.
  - No `move` listeners doing O(n) work.
  - UI panels are near-opaque (≥ 95%).

## 6. Dependencies (each with its reason; sizes are measured in Phase 1)
| Package | Why | Status |
|---|---|---|
| `maplibre-gl` 6.11.0 | WebGL map: markers on the GPU instead of ~300 DOM nodes; shapes Arabic itself (no glyph server) | approved 2026-10-16 · ≈ 285 KB + worker ≈ 143 KB gzip (`docs/spikes/2026-10-16-maplibre.md`) |
| `preact` 10.29.8 + `@preact/signals` 2.11.3 | component UI with fine-grained updates | approved 2026-10-16 · ≈ 8.7 KB gzip together |
| `vite`, `typescript`, `tailwindcss` + `@tailwindcss/vite`, `vite-plugin-pwa`, `workbox-window`, `vitest`, `@playwright/test` | build, styling, PWA, tests | as in the live app |

Versions are pinned exactly (no `^`) and locked by `package-lock.json`. Only versions published at least two weeks earlier are used, unless a fix requires a newer one.

## 7. Code splitting and loading
- **Initial chunk:** app shell, map, top bar, category row, sheet and place card.
- **Lazy chunks:**
  - `routing`, together with `streets.json` and `garage.json`, on the first route.
  - `search` palette, on first focus.
  - `stories`, `library` and `admin`.
- `i18n.json` (1.18 MB, all 26 languages) is split at build time into one file per language. Only the visitor's language loads; the tests keep reading the original file.
  - As built (phase 8): the `splitI18n` plugin serves `data/i18n.json` and the four string modules of `src/i18n` with Arabic and English in full, plus name/short/dir for the other 24. Each of those becomes `i18n/<code>.json`.
  - `src/i18n-next/load.ts` fetches the visitor's file and merges it into the packs `src/i18n` built, which `pack()` returns by reference.
  - The page awaits this before its first draw, and again on a language change. The service worker precaches the 24 files.
- Fonts use `font-display: swap`, with Arabic + Latin subsets precached and other scripts on demand.

## 8. Integration points (unchanged)
- Deep links: `map.html?poi=<id>`, `?visit=<id>`, `?lib=<id>`, `?admin=1` (asks for the supervisor password), `?lang=<code>`.
- The supervisor's page: «ADMIN» typed in the search box offers it, then `ui/admin/AdminGate.tsx` asks for the password, checked against a SHA-256 in `state/admin.ts`. This hides the page; it is not protection, as the check runs in the browser. Changes stay on that device until a server exists.
- Works inside a WebView: no cookies, no login, no server.
- Plain JSON data with stable ids.
- Site config lives in `src/config/site.config.ts`: site URL, QR, light tiles, organisation name.
- New data added by «next» (the live app's `data/` stays as it is) lives in `src/data-next/`. It imports nothing but types: first `car-entrances.ts`, three new vehicle entrances to the car park. They are shown by the map's `car-entrances` layer (with the parking pill only), and their open/closed state is `state/entrances.ts`, changed from the supervisor's page.
- Hosting: static files from `dist/`. `vercel.json` sets the Vite build for a new, separate Vercel project, `sw.js` uncached and hashed assets immutable (README «النشر»).

## 9. Quality gates
- `npm test`: Vitest, the ported unit tests + parity + new presentation, state and sheet-physics tests.
- `npm run test:e2e`: Playwright on the production build at phone size. The live app's journeys are rewritten one by one (`docs/PARITY.md`).
- `npm run build`: type-check + build.
- `npm run perf`: main-thread budgets (SPEC §6); frame times on a real device (`docs/CHECKLIST.md`, step 11).
